# Tetris Champ

*A useless and pointless version of Tetris bound to make you lose your sanity.*  

This game challenges your perspective on how you play games and forces you to deal with the consequences in a brutal way.  

## ðŸŽ® About the Game  

We live in a world where playing useless and pointless games is the real dealâ€”and thus, **Tetris Champ** was born.  

This game features the **weirdest controls imaginable**â€”randomized every single round to a random letter in the alphabet.  
Forget using **WASD** or arrow keys! Youâ€™ll be forced to play using **random keys like Q, K, or any other rarely used key.**  

But thatâ€™s not all...  

When we play games, we donâ€™t usually care about the consequences of failure.  
That ends with **Tetris Champ.**  
Every single time you fail a round of this **addictive yet rage-inducing game**, you get **slapped** by a robotic hand **with full force**â€”and you *WILL* feel it.
